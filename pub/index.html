        <h1>gitGantt... a new way to plan your week</h1>
        <p>When working on short term projects, it is often a challenge to plan tasks and measure progress. 
            gitGantt allows you to incorporate Gantt charts with regular day-to-day to-do lists to provide 
            you with the ultimate way of keeping your projects on schedule. With gitGantt you can add, remove, and edit tasks
        </p>
        <div\>
        <p>
            When you first create a Gantt chart, an empty Gantt chart is created with the top row signifying 
            the days of the week separated by lines.
        </p>
