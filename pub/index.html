        <h1>gitGantt... a new way to plan your week</h1>
        <h3>created by: bianca pokhrel</h3>
        <p>When working on short term projects, it is often a challenge to plan tasks and measure progress. 
            gitGantt allows you to incorporate Gantt charts with regular day-to-day to-do lists to provide 
            you with the ultimate way of keeping your projects on schedule. With gitGantt you can add, remove, and edit tasks
        </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            When you first create a Gantt chart, an empty Gantt chart is created with the top row signifying 
            the days of the week separated by lines. You can see that the Gantt chart is pretty small. Add tasks to it to make it larger!
        </p>

        <div id="gantt-chart"></div>
        <br/>
        <p>Let's add some more tasks!</p>

        <div id="adding-tasks"></div>

        <p>
            Now that we have some tasks in place, we can delete and also change the names and start/end days of them!
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p>
            Lastly, we can change our themes. In this version of the library, we have 4 available themes including the default theme.
            You can choose additional presets such as "summer day", "autumn morning", and "winter night". Here they are in order below!
        </p>

        <div id="summer-day-theme"></div>

        <br/>
        <div id="autumn-morning-theme"></div>
        <br/>
        <div id="winter-night-theme"></div>
