        <h1>Documentation for: gitGantt... a new way to plan your week</h1>
        <p>When working on short term projects, it is often a challenge to plan tasks and measure progress. 
            gitGantt allows you to incorporate Gantt charts with regular day-to-day to-do lists to provide 
            you with the ultimate way of keeping your projects on schedule. With gitGantt you can add, remove, and edit tasks
        </p>
        <div\>
        <p>
            To run the library please include the following lines to your script tag in your header tag in your HTML document as follows:
        </p>

        <div id="include-script"></div>
        <br/>
        <p>An external JavaScript file is required to be able to use this library. 
            Please make sure you include this file in your script tag. In the above example, 
            the gitGantt objects are loaded into the main HTML file using index.js</p>

        <h3> Creating an empty gitGantt chart</h3>
        <p> To create an empty gitGantt chart, please call the constructor with no parameters. An example is provided below:</p>

        <div id="create-empty_chart"></div>

        <br/>

            Lastly, we can change our themes. In this version of the library, we have 4 available themes including the default theme.
            You can choose additional presents such as "summer day", "autumn morning", and "winter night". Here they are in order below!
        </p>

        <div id="summer-day-theme"></div>

        <div id="autumn-morning-theme"></div>
        <br/>
        <div id="winter-night-theme"></div>
